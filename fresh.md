<h2> New Test </h2>

Alright, it is 2016 and I want to see if this still works how
I want it to work. 

```java
public int plus2(int n) {
	return n + 2;
}
```

```go
func main() {
		fmt.Println("Hello world!")
		fmt.Println(3 * 4)
		f := func() {
			return 8 * 2
		}
		a := f()
		fmt.Println(a)
}
```

Isn't Java great.
